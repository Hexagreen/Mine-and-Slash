3.8.17:
* Increased rate at which gear is modified/repaired, etc.
* Hopefully fixed a dupe bug occuring rarely with the modify station.

3.8.16:
* Staves give flat spell damage instead of percent, this was how it was always supposed to be!
* Fixed spell lifesteal and lifesteal not working correctly.
* Increased lifesteal amounts from Draconic and Vampiric Blood.
* Reduced mana scaling and projectile speed of Battery Fusilade at higher levels. Increased cooldown very slightly.
* New game changer node: Fortified Reaction - converts dodge into armor, but multi dodge -25%. Located on the right side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Pacifist - greatly increases heal power and reduces cooldowns, but deal 50% less spell damage. Located on the top-left side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Vampire - gives a large lifesteal and spell lifesteal multiplier, but makes you lose all health regen. Located on the bottom-left side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Stout Defender - gives a huge amount of block while reducing some other defensive stats. Located on the left side of the talent tree.
* Moved Steady Hand to the bottom side of the talent tree.
* Added a ring in the center of the tree to improve options for pathing to the other side of the tree. I tried to make it not too "easy" so it'll still require a decent amount of points.
* Added some cooldown reduction and heal power nodes sporadically around the tree (weighted to the left).
* Added some node connectors in the middle of the left side of the talent tree to improve pathing a bit.
* Reduced effectiveness of the Magical Life node - the node now also gives -25% multi magic shield.
* Mana Battery now reduces armor as well, but reduces health, armor and dodge at a lower amount than previously.
* Familiar Instincts now reduces health regeneration even further.
* Made some tooltip text a little more clearer.
* Reduced slow % from Frost effect. The way slow was calculated, zombies would be straight up freeze in place with 40%.
* Rare crash with tridents should be fixed.
* Actually fixed dodge and shield sounds from not playing!!!
* Dodging now prevents knockback. Doesn't make sense to go flying if you've dodged the attack...

3.8.15:
* Defensive Root no longer lasts 100 seconds (lol). lasts ~10 seconds like it was supposed to.
* Defensive Root has been reworking into Natural Empowering, which instead of providing a defense bonus, briefly increases base attack speed and energy regeneration.
* Critical damage nodes from the tree have been reduced slightly.
* Lowered movement speed reduction when casting spells.
* Lowered healing amount from Heart of Ice at higher levels by about 25%.
* Increased healing amount from Healing Aura by about 33%. Also lowered cooldown slightly.
* New chaos stat which applies speed buff on crit 50% of the time.
The following changes were made to give magic shield more identity vs. health, as well as making gameplay feel a bit smoother:
* Fixed a bug where HP/MS regen was adding more exhaustion than intended when restoring less than the max amount.
* You will now regen as long as you are above 15 hunger, instead of 18.
* Health, mana, and energy now regen every 3 seconds, down from 5. This should make regeneration feel a little smoother.
* Regen values for health, mana, and energy have been reduced to compliment the above change. You should regenerate approximately the same amount on average.
* Magic shield now only regens every 10 seconds, up from 5.
* Magic shield no longer adds exhaustion.
* Reduced magic shield flat stat effectiveness by 25%.
* Increased magic shield regeneration stat effectiveness greatly. Basically, you will regenerate more magic shield, and you can have higher pools of magic shield, but you will lack methods of instant recovery and will have to wait a while for it to regenerate. This basically makes it better for one shots but worse for prolonged battles.
* The Harmony trait used to split HP restoration effects with 50% going to health, and 25% going to magic shield. It now splits it 33%/33% between the two resources.

3.8.14:
* Hotfix for Battery Fusilade.
* Hotfix for party command spam lel

3.8.13:
* Hotfix for Flame Blitz.

3.8.12:
New Skills:
* New Hunting skills: the following AOE trap spells can be placed and are triggered upon enemy entry: Snare Trap (prevents enemy movement), Blast Trap (does damage), Enfeeble Trap (weakens enemy armor and resistances).
* New Fire skills: Flame Blitz (rapidly strike in melee range, scales from weapon damage), Draconic Blood & Vampiric Blood (team buff that gives spell/attack lifeleech, respectively), Spell Blade (gives caster a high amount of elemental infusion for a short period of time).
* New Storm skills: Critical and Power Surge (increases crit chance and reduces ele dmg, increases ele dmg and reduces crit chance, respectively), Quick Charge (team buff that reduces cooldowns but increases mana cost), Battery Fusilade (unload your mana to deal damage based on your total mana with multiple projectiles).
* New Nature skills: Root - root yourself in place to bolster your defenses. The following curses apply in AOE, have no cast time and have low cooldown (their effects are not as powerful, because of this): Corrosive Shadow (lowers enemy movement speed, armor, and dodge), Mortality Sap (lowers enemy critical hit chance and damage), Thought Seize (lowers enemy magic shield regen, mana regen, and resists).
* Throw Flames has been renamed as Meteoric Strike and has been reworked to not be a channel spell anymore.

The following few changes were made to improve mixing different spell trees:
* Instead of having Cold Essence increase your frost damage (which only benefits the Ocean tree), it now provides a small amount of mana and energy regen (which benefits all builds).
* Tidal Wave's Freezing Waves no longer consumes Frost Essence and just does extra damage if the enemy is Frosted.
* Whirlpool's synergy has been changed to Rejuvenating Pool which applies the new Cold Essence.
* The Shiver effect is now obsolete/unused. With the new changes, elemental resist reduction has been moved off of Ocean, which now focuses more on sustain and utility. Additionally, it seemed sort of redundant to have so many Ocean effects with similar names.
* Thorns no longer reduces fire resist and now reduces healing power and health regen slightly.
* Burn now reduces ALL elemental resists by 5% instead of reducing frost resist by 20%.
* Frost now reduces elemental damage by 10% instead of reducing lightning resist. It now also slows by 40% instead of 50%.
* Static now reduces ALL elemental resists by 20% instead of nature/lightning.
* Lightning Essence now provides 20% to ALL elemental SPELL damage rather than just all lightning damage. It now also provides 40% less critical hit chance than previously (5% -> 3%), but this is because the new lightning skill adds quite a lot.

Other Balance Changes:
* Martyrdom and Retribution have been changed to physical damage type.
* A bunch of skills have had their max level reduced to compensate for the increased number of skills. This does mean however, that some of them are not as strong as they used to be at max level. I did this because players were unable to invest in two trees.
* True Hit now grants a 25% Crit Chance Multiplier rather than 20% Crit Damage Multiplier.
* Whirlwind base scaling values have been reduced at earlier levels but remains similar to what it was before at max level.
* Fixed Poison Cloud spamming console.
* Spell effects such as Burn now show the appropriate element (fire in this case).
* Added back buttons to the GUI where appropriate. No more pressing ESC and then H!
* Party commands now provide text feedback.
* Fixed some tooltip errors with some currency.
* Fixed an issue with Blazing Inferno, Charged Nova, Poison Cloud, and Whirlwind where you could reset their cooldowns for free.
* Increased damage of Ice Orb by 33% at early levels, and about 12.5% at max level.
* Nourishment grants 20% more health regeneration.
* Fixed a bug where Blizzard was freezing the user instead of mobs...
* Whirlwind no longer knocks back enemies.
* Purifying Flames and Martyrdom now knockback enemies.
* Recoil of Hunter now provides 1 stack on cast instead of 3, which makes sense because the max stack is 1 anyway. Consequently, the max level for the synergy is now 1.
* You now receive more critical damage and less dodge from Hunter Instinct.
* You now receive a lot more dodge from Wind Walk.
* Added some new hybrid elemental damage mob suffixes.
* You now move twice as slow as you would before while casting spells.

3.8.11:
* New stat: Spell Lifesteal! Lifesteal, but for spells!
* Added lifesteal and spell lifesteal nodes to the tree.
* Life/spell lifesteal now has a minimum of 1. So even if you do 6 damage with 1% lifesteal, you will still heal 1 HP.
* Major Arcana stat "Judgment" now provides spell lifesteal, and the "thirst of" affixes provide a minor amount of spell lifesteal instead of lifesteal.
* Increased crit hit and damage percents and multis, flat values are still the same.
* Nature's Balm has had its values readjusted again (buff).
* Flat physical damage values have been lowered, but percent has been increased. This means physical will about 20% less damage early game, but investing into physical damage will improve it about 30% more.
* Increased early game effectiveness of Retribution.
* Fixed some localization typos and made some stats/skills more clear. "Judgment" is now spelled correctly, yay!
* Plate gear now also provides armor.
* Leather gear provides a bit less HP.
* Increased durability of equipment, especially at lower rarities.
* Lessened the effect of gear damage on loot drop at lower levels. You will still definitely feel this at higher levels.
* Vanilla ores provide a little more fuel than they used to.
* Setting tiers in the Dimension Config should work now.

3.8.10:
* Added a new Hunting Skill: Hunter's Potion, instantly recover % HP on a long cooldown.
* I went a little too far, re-added some benefits to the core stats.
* Improved the spell damage percent mod max roll by 50%.
* Changed the max level of some Hunting skills.
* You now can unlock the Wind spells 5 mastery levels earlier.
* Improved the Wind spells.
* Reduced cooldown of Retribution.

3.8.9:
* An issue with skill rotation was that it required too many points into other secondary skills (Fire Bombs, Charged Nova, etc.) in order for them to be even useful. The initial cooldowns were too great, but were more or less fine at max level. To combat this, level 1 cooldowns for almost ALL spells has been reduced significantly, and max level cooldown remains more or less untouched.
* Ball + Thunder Spear spells have been slightly readjusted again, their early game effectiveness has been improved.
* The above changes also mean that you will see slightly less benefits to putting points into one spell, but is still useful to do so. It encourages branching out as well!
* Silent Wind movement speed reduction has been lowered.
* Nature's Balm has been reduced in effectiveness.

3.8.8:
* You will need to reset your skills after updating to this version!
* The goal of the following changes was to offset some of the power players were getting from raw stats. Now, it is more encouraged to split into two trees. Especially since there are more buffs available now.
* Core stats have been reworked. They now give much less benefits than previously.
* Ocean Tree and Divine Tree have been reworked heavily, there are 4 new skills for the Ocean Tree!
* Too many changes for Ocean Tree... TL;DR there are new buff skills and healing has been changed to heal over time.
* Hunting Tree now has 2 new buffs known as "Winds", you can activate only one of them at a time.
* Heart of Ice has been completely changed. It now works more like the old Healing Aura from the Divine Tree, which has also been reworked into a spammable.
* New Frozen effect that can be applied by a new Ocean skill - Arctic Breath (including Blizzard). Frozen enemies take additional damage when basic attacked and cannot move.
* Heavy Strike has been changed to Martyrdom - it now scales off of HP instead of weapon damage.
* Ground Slam has been changed to Retribution - it now scales off of armor instead of weapon damage.
* Some tooltip clarifications have been made.
* Casting spells no longer damages the item you are holding.
* Repair values have been ever so slightly increased. Common ore is still bad.
* Fixed localization error on Crystal of Ascension.
* Reduced Crit Multi of True Hits perk to 20%, from 30%.
* Reduced the power of Critical Hits/Damage substantially.
* Reduced effectiveness of penetration slightly.
* Reduced the power of Fire Bombs and Burn effect by about 25-33%.
* Reduced the power of ball spells and Thunder Spear very slightly.
* Divine auras now require varying mastery levels. They have had their values shifted slightly, as well.
* Added an HP multiplier config to dimension configs.
* There have been other minor adjustments that have not been logged.

3.8.7:
* Reduced mana cost and cooldown of Whirlwind, and very slightly reduced damage scaling.
* Map drop rate bonus when in maps has been increased from 4% --> 15%.
* Crystal of Ascension now has a level of 15 levels instead of 10.
* Stone of Corruption now increases an item's level by 5 rather than 2.

3.8.6:
* Fixed the Nether wart farm room not spawning in correctly, leaving players with an impossible map.

3.8.5:
* Inconsistencies in element naming has been fixed. Nature = Nature, Ocean = Frost, Storm = Lightning.
* Fixed some missing localization.
* Updated Divine Tree description to better reflect what it has become.

3.8.4:
* Mob experience on kill no longer takes into account only the highest damage from player, but rather from all players. Before, a mob with 12 HP could have taken 6 environment damage, 4 damage from player A, and 2 damage from player B, but distribute no experience because player A's 4 dmg < 6. Now, it'll still attribute the kill to player A, but will take into account all player damage, so 4 + 2 = 6 which is at least 50% of the mob's health. This should make party play feel a LOT better.
* You now receive an additional 20% experience for each member on the team. So 2 players get 120% / 2 = 60% per person, 3 players get 140% / 3 = 47% per person, etc.
* Fixed block sounds being played on bleed.
* You now must use a pickaxe to mine ores.
* You now require at least a stone pickaxe to mine ores.
* Ore blocks now use datapacks and can be smelted down into ores if mined with Silk Touch. This is particularly useful in enabling compatibilty with technology mods.
* Ore world gen rates for ores have been increased very slightly.
* Made it very slightly easier for players to get the kill when compared against environment damage.
Balance Changes:
* Increased cooldown of "ball" spells by 1s. Thunder Spear's cooldown was increased by 0.5s.
* The following changes were made to make Fire feel more consistent:
* Increased mana cost of Fireball at max level by ~9%.
* Doubled Burn proc. chance for Fire spells.
* Reduced damage of Burn by ~55%.
* Reduced tick rate and duration of Burn at max level slightly.
* Increased Thunder Spear damage by ~20%.
* Increased Static proc. chance for Lightning Totem.
* Ice Orb has more pretty particles.
* Increased cooldown of Heavy Strike by 1s.
* Increased attack scaling of Ground Slam by 20% at max level.
* Increased cooldown of Ground Slam by 1s at max level.

3.8.3:
* You should be able to interact with most gravestone mods in maps now.
* Dank Storage is now retrievable in maps if you accidentally place one down.
* Fixed some map rooms with signs as placeholders for mobs and loot. They should now properly spawn.
* Improved consistency of Spruce Mansion redstone room.

3.8.2:
* Reduced armor reduction of Enrage slightly.
* Fixed tick rate of console spam.
* You can now interact with shulker boxes in Adventure Maps.
* Increased energy cost of weapons. The cost in general was too low and it wasn't really necessary to allocate stats into energy sustain.

3.8.1:
* Added particles to basically every spell, and increased particle count for most spells. This should help with visual acuity!
* Fixed Arrow Barrage shooting only 1 arrow.
* Went a little overboard last patch: ball spell damage has been increased very slightly again.
* Physical spells have had a minor reduction in damage.
* Cooldowns of basically ALL (except ball) spells has been reduced GREATLY. I'm pushing spell rotation over spamming one spell!
* Increased chance to proc effects for some spells.

3.8.0:
* All weapons now roll different secondary stats. Melee weapons no longer have any weapon damage multiplier - axes no longer do double damage. Energy cost has been changed to reflect this, and the addition of new secondary stats should more than make up for this. The reason for this change was because spells didn't take into account the weapon damage multiplier. Ergo, physical spells should feel _much_ better to use now with all melee weapons. Bows and crossbows more or less remain unchanged (slightly reduced damage with addition of new stats).
* New Ocean spell: Ice Orb - shoot an orb of ice that sprays enemies in its path.
* New Nature spell: Poison Cloud - applies Thorns to nearby enemies (large AOE).
* New Hunting spell: Dash - literally a dash.
* New Physical effect: Enrage - makes enemies move fast and deal more damage, but take increased damage.
The following spell changes were made for a few reasons. Mages were a little too strong for the amount of investment they had to make. Also, a lot of builds devolved into ball spam, and other "stronger" and utility-based spells were not seeing as much play.
* Ball spells are now affected by cooldown but have had their cooldown increased. Their cooldowns are also now fixed and will not change upon leveling them.
* Ball spells and Thunder Spear have had their damage reduced by a lot. Emphasis is on skill rotation now.
* Hunting spells no longer have any cast time and have been greatly improved.
* Reduced max projectile count of Ground Slam.
* Physical spells have had their damage increased.
* Heavy Strike and Whirlwind have new synergies.
* Magma Flower's duration has increased, and mana cost decreased.
* Nature spells have been greatly improved (Gorgon's Gaze is actually good) and are more geared towards weapon damage --> spell damage rather than a weird hybrid.
* Nature's Balm healing has increased slightly.
* Storm and Ocean spells have been reduced in power slightly, while Fire has seen a general buff.
* All stack effects (Thorns, Burn, etc.) have been reworked. There is an issue with stacks that need to be fixed but in the meantime this band-aid fix should suffice.

3.7.9:
* Fixed incorrect synergy icon/text for Frostball.
* Fixed all elemental spell damage stat not working.

3.7.8:
Changes were made to balance physical vs. elemental spells. Elemental spells are more or less the same but investing into them should be a lot more rewarding. I tried to make it more viable to go for elemental builds over the current OP physical builds. As always, my goal is to slowly improve the balance between the elements, and to provide each one with a unique identity. Currently, water is utility/damage since it provides many slows and can boost the power of the other elements greatly. Fire scales slightly with weapon damage and has an improved burn. Thunder is pure spell damage. Nature is tank/DoT, and Hunting is bow. Currently, Divine is split between support and physical spells.

* Fixed BossPacket console spam.

* Added some new perk nodes around the tree.
* Added armor penetration to Reckless Blows but increased armor reduction from it as well.
* Increased elemental damage reduction from Overflowing Vitality.

* Increased duration of Whirlwind.
* Reduced mana cost of Whirlwind.

* Increased projectile speed very slightly for "ball" skills.
* Increased slightly the cooldown of the "ball" skills. Overall elemental skills see a reduction in cooldown though.
* Reduced mana costs of most elemental skills.
* Increased base value of most elemental skills.
* Frostball now generates Frost stacks instead of consuming them, and tidal wave consumes them instead of generating them.
* Increased attack scaling moderately on most elemental skills that have it.
* Increased power of burning effect.
* It is now much easier to generate Burn stacks using Fire Ball and Frost stacks with Frostball.
* Increased level 1 attack scaling of Thorns, max level remains the same.
* The max stacks for Frost has increased from 5 --> 10.
* The slow per stack for Frost has reduced from 8% --> 7% per stack. Overall, you can now slow enemies by 30% more.
* Shiver now reduced Fire and Thunder resistance by 50%, up from 15%.
* Static now reduces only Thunder resistance, and reduces (base value) 3% per stack, up from 1%.
* Static now has a max of 8 stacks, up from 3. The only source of Static is from Lightning Totems, which has seen a general damage nerf because of this change.

3.7.7:
* Fixed some broken nodes on tree.

3.7.6:
* COMPLETELY revamped the talent tree. There are many more paths to take now!

Balance Changes:
* Increased duration and radius, and reduced cooldown of Blizzard, Volcano, and Thunderstorm.
* Crit effectiveness has been further reduced by a small amount.
* Defensive options have been modified a bit to give each one some more identity. Health and armor is harder to stack while magic shield and dodge is easier to stack.

3.7.5:
* Fixed bosses not summoning in maps.
* Fixed name of thunderstorm synergy.

Balance Changes:
* Increased mana cost and cooldown of Lightning Totem.
* Very slightly reduced damage, radius, and tick rate of Lightning Totem.

3.7.4:
* Changed bag recipes to use any wooden chest with the appropriate tag instead of vanilla chests.
* Reduced the effectiveness of critical hit modifiers by about 20%. Critical hits is still strong but will require a bit more investment.
* Fixed merchant dupe bug.
* Fixed boss spawn bug.
* Made some spell tooltips a bit more clear.
* Probably fixed energy not being restored with Thunder Dash.
* Reduced energy cost of bows.
* Reduced damage of bows and crossbows slightly.

* Reduced mana cost of Blazing Inferno from 30 -> 45 to 25 -> 35.
* Increased duration of Volcano from 4s -> 5s to 4s -> 6s.

Storm Tree:
* Changed some level requirements of the Storm Tree.
* Added a new skill for Storm: Charged Nova - behaves similar to Blazing Inferno but is geared towards spellcasters.
* Added a new synergy for Thunderstorm: Charged Storm which increases the tick rate and radius of Thunderstorm.
* Reduced projectile speed of Thunder Spear from 2 -> 3 to 2 -> 2.5.
* Reduced base value of Thunder Spear from 8 -> 28 to 4 -> 16. The increased projectile speed of this spell from the last buff made	made it much easier to bounce between targets.

All Spells:

* Increased radius of totem and flower spells by 100%.

it doesn't help that I didn't have time to play test my mod)

3.6.14
* fix divine buffs expiring randomly after a few seconds

3.6.13
* dungeon chests now have a chance to give vanilla items that are dictated by lootables. (meaning configurable by modpack devs)
Low lvl maps give stuff like coal, mid lvl give gold, and high lvl maps can give even diamonds!
* fixed more dungeon signs
* fix stations dupe bug

3.6.12
* implemented an experimental simple way to minimize effectiveness of mob farms (ill implement configs later, first i need to see if it works)

3.6.11
* should fix mana cost reduction throwing exception on synergies that dont cost mana.

3.6.10
* starter item config is now common config

3.6.9
* trying out performance optimizations
* added ignored entities config, this stops stat data packets from being sent to client,
 should make servers less laggy as most entities are bats and fish, and you don't really care about their stats. 
 You could also add sheep for example, if you have a huge sheep farm that's laggy.
 * orb of blessing can no longer reroll unique gear's stats
 * orb of unique blessing can now only reroll them, and the instability hit is now much higher (as unique gears are much less random now, i'm toning down the amount of times you can modify them)
* made starter items a newbie gear bag instead. the bag now gives same items every time. 

3.6.8

3.6.0

SPELL REWORK!
* spell tree has been remade into masteries.
* spells and synergies now have levels
* synergies now cost mana
* removed some spells as i consider them bad (like geyser) and others because their spell school doesn't have enough spells, they'll probably be re-added later
* added some new spells
* spell damage stats are now percents and increase spell damage by percent, instead of adding to the damage.
* infusion reworked
* added cooldown reduction, mana cost reduction and cast rate stats (they might not be used yet though, but they're there)
* added +1 to spell school levels stat
* removed elemental conversion and transfer stats, mostly useless after spell damage became a percent
* huge easy aoe spells now have much larger cooldown, added other semi aoe spells that are harder to hit and can't hit that many enemies at once.
* added a new rune that adds levels to specific spells, you'll need that for after level 45

What should happen with the rework:
* players should think more about how many points they want to spend and where
* players should decide between base stats or spell levels
* players should be able to play 2 schools of magic that use different elements without feeling useless
* magic should be less op at endgame and more useful at early game.
* aoe clearing a bunch of mobs should be much harder to do, especially from range, as high aoe spells are under long cooldown

If the system didn't make some of these happen, please tell me about it.

Other:
* bosses now spawn less minions but they're all max rarity
* blocking fully now stops attack knockbacks. can't figure out how to stop the attack sounds though
* made vanilla teams usable for exp and friendly fire off.
* casting spells now slows you down
* server performance improvements (syncing mob stat packets to client should lag server less now as i almost cut down the packet size in half)
* added all the buildathon rewards that people asked for (still many didn't come claim them though)
* fixed unique cangetset field not doing anything in datapacks
* mobs now have a small chance to increase their own rarity and level by killing other mobs. (experimental feature but i think it will be good)
* decreased default regen hunger cost
* made weapon costs scale with weapon level. This is experimental until i see if it can be abused or not. If people find some way of using lvl 1 weapons to do a lot of damage 
then i'll have to switch back to scaling costs to player level.
* spells levels now dictate their damage and mana costs too. To get maximum player level of spell effectiveness you'll need +1 to skill level gear stats. (5 or 6 of them)
* added new affixes and runeword.
* increase default stat points per lvl
* as talents pic is no longer 3 mb, starting talents shouldnt freeze game anymore
* potion of spell reset now gives 10 spell reset points instead of 1, but its a bit more expensive
* added a lot more dungeon rooms by @Eclipse
