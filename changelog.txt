Misc:
* Reorganized the Mastery GUI layout.

3.10.3:
Stat Changes:
* Stat changes below are to encourage users to pour into other stats instead of just a single stat. Also, some changes, such as moving mana/magic shield regen to wisdom were made to make putting stats into wisdom feel less "bad" when not going for magic shield. You'll notice I basically shifted things around.
* Vit (before): health, health regen --> (after) health, armor
* Strength (before): physical damage, armor --> (after) physical damage, critical damage
* Intelligence (before): elemental spell damage, mana, mana regen --> (after) elemental spell damage, magic shield, mana
* Wisdom (before): magic shield, magic shield regen --> (after) heal power, magic shield regen, mana regen

* Maps now give bonus EXP in addition to bonus loot.
* Painful Truths has been reworked to halve bonus loot and quadruple bonus EXP instead of shifting bonus loot to bonus EXP.

* Fixed missing localization for spell costs.
* Spells that modify attack scaling now display how much they'll modify it by if you hold shift.
* Cleaned up the Stat Info GUI.

* Bleed Mastery now gives -25% to all elemental damage instead of -20%.
* Fortified Reaction now gives a -20% multi to armor instead of -25% multi to dodge. I believe the multiplier was applying after the conversion, therefore not doing anything.
* Warlock now gives 20% DoT lifesteal instead of 80%. Yeah I don't really know what I was thinking. I made this before the DoT buffs, okay?
* Magical Life now gives -20% multi to health instead of -25% multi to magic shield for reasons similar to above. It also now only gives 20% cooldown reduction instead of 25%.
* Pacifist now gives 30% FLAT heal power instead of multi, and -30% FLAT spell power instead of -90% multi.
* Reckless Blows now gives 25% FLAT penetration rather than multi. It now gives -30% multi also to dodge and magic shield.

* Steady Hand now gives 20% more damage, down from 25%.
* Vampire now give a FLAT 6% attack lifesteal and 3% spell lifesteal instead of giving multi. This was a good node but only after investing enough points. I want this to be impactful early game as well.
* Changed the Talent Tree major elemental weapon damage nodes to big. So that's 60% -> 30%. 60% is crazy.
* Changed the Talent Tree weapon nodes at the bottom of the tree from big to major.
* Changed some Talent Tree mana nodes from big to small, and major to big.
* Increased magic shield and magic shield regen Talent Tree node effectiveness.
Spells:
* Attack Spell synergies now also increase the energy cost.

* Hunting Potion cooldown now reduces at double the rate per level.

* Wide Shot max projectile count has been reduced from 9 to 7 at max level.
* Recoil Shot physical scaling value has increased slightly.

* Changed the sound of out of mana or energy to that of a villager to make it more OBVIOUS you're OOM.
* Reworded some of the reset potions to make more sense.

3.10.0:
* New damage type: Attack Spells. These can trigger "on-attack" effects such as Poisoned Weapon's synergy, or Frozen/Petrify on-attack effects. They are also still affected by changes to spell damage.
* Previous spells such as Whirlwind, Martyrdom, Retribution, Tidal Waves, Flame Blitz, etc., are now Attack Spells.
* All Hunting spells that use arrows are now classified as Attack Spells.
* Hunting spells that use arrows are now properly physical damage. They can still deal elemental damage with the new "attack spell damage type".
* Spells that previously scaled off of all attack damage now scale off of physical attack damage only. Elemental attack damage will now apply separately instead of being converted into a single element. This is technically a small nerf late-game as you can't really "double-dip" for spells that converted from all elements -> one element. But should be unchanged early game. Plus, with the new damage type... Melee and Archery got buffed pretty hard late game.
* Spell tooltips have been revamped to clearly indicate whether something is a Attack Spell, Spell, etc.

3.9.18:
* Oops, forgot to add tooltip indicators for which damage is DoT damage. Currently only Wounds, Burn, Thorns, and Bleed.

3.9.17:
* Medium-sized talent tree update: some areas of the tree have been reworked to incorporate FOUR new gamechanger perks, and a new perk type. A lot of the changes are top-right heavy. Some general balance changes have also been made.
* New Perk/Stat type: Increased Damage over Time Damage - this affects DoT effects ONLY (not spells like Blizzard). Currently, this means Burn, Thorns, Wounds, and Bleed. These perks can be found throughout the tree.
* New Stat: DoT Lifesteal - steals HP from DoT effects. Before, when effects such as Burn were considered spell damage, it was possible to leech from those effects. This is meant as a replacement, but currently there is only one way to get it (Warlock node).
* New Gamechanger Node: Ruthless - Increases DoT damage, but reduces spell damage.
* New Gamechanger Node: Warlock - gives your DoTs a HUGE lifesteal effect and slightly increases DoT damage at the expense of your health and magic shield.
* New Gamechanger Node: Side Step - provides bonuses to dodge and spell dodge at the expense of armor, magic shield, and block chance.
* New Gamechanger Node: Power Overwhelming - provides a large bonus to spell damage, but removes chance to crit.
* Changed percent infusion on the tree to flat infusion.
* Small buff to weapon damage talent nodes from 5% -> 6%.
* Small buff to weapon elemental damage talent nodes from 8% -> 12%.
* Small buff to phys damage talent nodes from 3% -> 8%. This apparently only affects basic attack physical damage. No wonder physical late game was so bad!
* Changed a lot of the phys damage talent nodes to apply to ALL phys damage.
* Added a FEW energy regen nodes around the tree. I realized that energy shouldn't be specific to bottom-right as everyone uses it.
* Collapsed some really large elemental wheels (mostly top of tree) into smaller combined wheels to make space for other effects.
* New Synergy for Spell Blade: Flame Blade - causes basic attacks to deal AOE fire damage upon hitting an enemy while under the effects of Spell Blade.
* Spell Blade and Poisoned Weapons have received major buffs.
* Holy Retribution and Poison Thorn Seeker are now affected by increase spell damage stats.
* Bleed now deals 25% of your weapon damage per stack, up from 8%! I realized even 64% of weapon damage per second is not very good. Now be rewarded when you apply max stacks. :)
* Reduced the duration of Bleed from 8s -> 6s.
* Reduced damage of Burn at max level by about 9%.
* Increased max stacks of Burn from 4 -> 6.
* Burn now always ticks every second and does not scale per level.
* Increased the damage of Thorns by some amount.
* Increased max stacks of Thorns from 10 -> 12.
* Thorns now always ticks every 2 seconds and does not scale per level.
* Increased duration of Thorns and Burn.
* Wounds now scales with attack damage instead of having a base damage. This should make it actually worthwhile to apply, as 3 stacks are applied at once with Recoil Shot.
* Wounds now always ticks every second and does not scale per level.
* Wounds now reduces health regeneration rather than heal power.
* Battery Fusilade's Overcharge radius increases with level.
* Fixed Wounds not applying multiple stacks at once.
* Fixed a bug where Wounds was lasting much longer than it was supposed to.
* Fixed Bleed mastery not working properly.
* Added a death message for custom_damage.
* Improved tooltips for some of the conversion stats.
* Added extra tooltip info for some spells.
* Fixed some missing localization.

3.9.16:
* Fixed effects not actually applying to enemies/allies... This whole time buffs and curses didn't even work as intended!!!
* Damage from allies should no longer affect magic shield!
* Managed to get the stack effects working again! That means effects like Burn, Thorns, Bleed now have more than a max stack of 1, and stacking the effect will increase the stat and damage effects! Most of the effects have been reworked (and in most cases, buffed).
* An example of above: Bleed now has a max of 8 stacks, and instead of doing 25% of your phys damage per second, you do 8% per stack for a max of 64% (yes this is also a huge buff).
* Buff spells now apply to allies only and not enemies. Yeah, I know.
* Effect levels can now have points put into them starting at level 5. It didn't make sense to be able to Burn enemies at level 5, but the Burn effect itself did nothing till level 10.
* Defend armor buff has been nerfed by 20%.
* Frost Shield now has a longer cooldown but also applies Magic Shield Regen.
* Reduced the power, increased the cooldown of Retribution - especially the early game.
* Increased number of projectiles at max level for Retribution.
* Fires of Judgment now gives Purifying Fires a chance to apply Judgment instead of dealing extra damage to targets with Judgment.
* Holy Retribution now provides extra armor scaling to damage if target has Judgment instead of giving Retribution the chance to apply Judgment.
* Judgment is now a skillable passive rather than being tied to Spear of Judgment.
* Judgment now scales alone rather than off of the Spear of Judgment spell.
* Burn, Thorns are now DOT damage type and not spell damage type.
* Revamped Spell GUI a bit - colour of text now indicates whether you cannot put points, have points in it, or are receiving + bonus level to spells. Also, unavailable spells no longer have a "red background" and instead have lower saturation.
* Completely new set of spell icons thanks to Skullbushi! Check out their work here: https://www.instagram.com/skullbushi/

3.9.15:

3.9.14:
* Fixed Charge spell not being registered.
* Magma Flower heal synergy has been improved.
* Increased saturation of GUI bar elements.
* Swapped colour for energy bar and EXP bar.

* Magic Shield overlay now doesn't completely overlap the health bar. Now you can see how much HP you're losing due to environmental effects (no more random deaths?).
* Arcane Devotion is now a -95% multi to HP instead of -1000%. Users should be able to "counterplay" environmental effects rather than being killed with no way out.
* Battery Fusilade's Overcharge synergy now has an AOE of 1, down from 2.
* Exert now grants arrows with an AOE of 1, down from 2.
* Reworded Magma Flower synergies.

* New Divine Spell: Defend - apply a short buff on nearby allies, granting a large boost to armor.
* New Fire Spell: Steam Cloud - emit steam from your body, damaging nearby enemies for a brief duration.

* New Ocean Spell: Magic Burst - deal damage to nearby enemies based on your magic shield.
* Heart of Ice synergy now increases heal for all healed rather than just the user.
* Healing Wave now heals in a cone in front rather than around the user.
* Lightning Dash now costs MUCH less mana at max level, and has had its cooldown reduced from 4s to 3s.
* Reduced the mana cost of most Nature spells.
* Leveling Poison Cloud reduces its cast time more per level.
* Increased Spear of Judgment damage value.
* Added swing on arm cast to most spells that were missing it.
* Area of Effect is now a float rather than int. Before, 2.9 radius was the same as 2.0.

3.9.12:
* New Nature Spell: Rock Slide - a spell that summons a rock barrage on enemies.
* New Fire Spell: Lava Quake - a cone AoE melee spell.
* New Hunting Spell: Exert - similar to Imbue, buffs your arrow spells. But instead of adding damage, arrows will explode on contact and do half damage in a small area. This effect CAN stack with Imbue.
* New Synergy for Rock Slide: Stone Sharpnel - turns Rock Slide into a "storm" spell.
* New Synergy for Battery Fusilade: Overcharge - projectiles release a small AoE upon hitting an enemy.
* Dash now propels you twice as fast/far.
* Lightning Spear mana cost reduced slightly.
* Fire Ball now travels almost 3x faster and lasts 1 second instead of 3 seconds. It should feel a lot more responsive to use now.
* Poison Ball now shoots 3 projectiles instead of 1, and travels much slower. I want to give each "ball" spell more identity.
* Corrosive Shadow, Thought Seize, Mortality Sap, Poison Cloud, Gorgon's Gaze, and Freeze can no longer affect allies.
* Reduced number of arrows per wave of Arrow Storm.
* Imbue now provides less of a damage boost.
* You can now learn Spell Blade 5 mastery levels earlier.
* You can now learn the Trap spells earlier.

3.9.11:
* Tidal Wave and Retribution no longer pierce. They have been buffed accordingly to compensate for the unintended multi-hit effect.
* Whirlpool now correctly does frost damage instead of elemental damage.
* Fixed Elemental Damage not being converted properly with Ele to Physical Conversion.
* Regeneneration typo.

3.9.10:s
* Buffed weapon damage and elemental weapon damage nodes on the tree.
* Fixed the new nodes on the left.

3.9.9:
* Mastery now scales 1:1 with your max level instead of scaling based on your max level. This also means that spells scale with your total mastery level rather than the mastery level of the tree, encouraging dual-mastery spec. Previously, they scaled at approximately your mastery level * 2 for each individual mastery (capped at about half your max level, so level 10 Fire would be the max for a player level 20, and would scale to level 20). Now, you need 20 points in Fire mastery in order for spells to scale to player level 20. That also means at level 60, you'd need 50 points in Fire (max), and 10 points in another tree to fully scale. Fundamentally, this allows players to go mono-spec and not be punished for allocating all their points into one tree until level 50, where they will probably need to spec into another tree. Additionally, this means that spells will be faster to obtain without punishment - you can get Volcano at level 50, instead of losing on potential stats if you "rushed" for it previously.
* You can no longer allocate points into your mastery level so that your total mastery level is higher than your max level.
* The previous mastery system just seemed uninuitive to new players. Most would want to specialize in just one tree, so with the new change, you can do that, and still be rewarded for going dual-spec. Of course, by level 51 you'll need to be speccing into 2 different trees anyway.
* New synergies for: Lightning Totem, Charged Nova, Blast Trap.
* Substantially reduced the cooldown of ALL spells except for the "ultimate" spells.
* Tidal Wave now pierces enemies.
* Increased shoot speed of Tidal Wave.
* Increased damage of Purifying Fires.
* Increased heal of Healing Wave.
* Healing Wave now casts instantly.
* Increased damage of "ultimate" spells (except Volcano).
* Synergies Charged Storm, Magma Bloom, and Piercing Winds have been reworked slightly to augment the spell rather than straight up improve it.
* Fixed a missing item word.
* Hopefully fixed zombies spawning like crazy on top of map dungeons.

3.9.8:
* Fixed Lightning Essence being given to enemies rather than the player...
* Fixed Power Surge and Quick Surge not giving elemental damage.
* Improved some tooltip descriptions.

3.9.7:
* Fixed new nodes giving lifesteal instead of the new gain stat.

3.9.6:
* Bravery health and block chance has been improved.
* Trickery critical hit has been improved.
* Divine auras provide a little more of their core stat.
* New stats: Physical to Fire/Nature/Lightning/Frost Weapon Damage stat, which ADDS % of physical damage as elemental attack damage.
* New stat: Elemental to Physical Conversion, which converts all elemental weapon damage into physical damage.
* Shifted some talents around on the tree.
* Increased the effectiveness of many nodes on the tree: elemental nodes, physical damage nodes, spell damage nodes, heal power nodes. Also improved weapon and elemental weapon damage nodes.
* New keystone talent on the warrior branch: Berserker's Impartiality. Converts half of your elemental damage into physical damage.
* New nodes on the left side of the tree which add 25% of physical weapon damage gained as [insert element] weapon damage.
* Bleed from the Bleed Mastery passive now lasts 8 seconds, up from 3.
* Bleed from the Bleed Mastery passive now does 25% of your physical weapon damage, up from 15%.
* Fixed a localization error.
* Hopefully improved the responsiveness of Dash and Thunder, also the weird error where the two spells become non-responsive has hopefully been fixed.
* Increased distance of Thunder Dash, and increased its area of effect.
* Reduced mana scaling of Battery Fusillade by a flat 1% at max level (8% -> 7%).
* Retribution now lasts only 2 seconds but slowly increases back to 3 seconds, down from a flat 3 seconds at all levels.
* Retribution now pierces through enemies - it will continue to hit enemies beyond the first.
* Retribution is no longer affected by gravity.
* Blazing Inferno now scales of off all weapon damage rather than just fire weapon damage - I missed this last time.
* Spell Blade now provides 25% Fire Infusion, and provides "gain 25% of your physical damage as fire weapon damage". That's a straight up 25% increase in attack damage!
* Poisoned Weapons no longer provides a measly flat nature attack damage boost, but turns at least 50% of your physical damage to nature weapon damage, and then provides a small nature weapon damage bonus.
* Tick rate of Ice Orb has been reduced slightly at max level (nerf).
* Reduced attack scaling of Tidal Wave by a flat 10%.
* Tidal Wave now casts 2 -> 3 times rather than 3 -> 4.
* Tidal Wave now has a static 1 second channeling time.

3.9.5:
* Ice Orb now passes through enemies and deals extra damage to enemies it passes through.
* Ice Orb tick rate has been nearly doubled.
* Stout Defender now provides 50% increased block chance instead of 100%.
* Changed some armor nodes into block nodes and vice-versa.

3.9.4:
* Cleaned up some party code.
* Commented out some debugging stuff.
* Fixed the tooltip of Mana Battery. It reduces damage by 50%, not 25%.
-----BALANCE CHANGES-----
Stats and Traits:
* Major change to how block works. It now has a % chance to block damage fully, rather than blocking a flat amount of damage. Additionally, if you have your shield up but your block fails, you will still reduce damage by 25%. This is (imo) a major improvement to how shields worked before, and falls in line with how blocking works in other ARPGs.
* Critical hit and critical damage should now be slightly easier to stack.
* Dodge rating and armor now max out at 95%, up from 90% and 80%, respectively. Because of how these stats are calculated, this also means it is 5.55% and 18.75% easier to stack the respective stats (huge buff for armor).
* Dodge rating and armor stats are now slightly more effective, except max dodge rating percent has been reduced by 4%.
* Health regen, magic shield, and magic shield regen stat values have been increased slightly.
* Health flat stat values have been decreased slightly.

* BUFF: Stout Defender now has a -25% multi on stats from -30%.

* Thorn Bush now ticks at a higher rate at higher levels.
* Reduced the mana cost of the Nature curse spells.
* Reduced movement speed bonus from Wind Walk by 25%.
* Reduced critical hit bonus from Silent Wind from 10% -> 7%.
* Reduced movement speed penalty from Silent Wind by 40%.

* Increased the base value of Thunder Spear.
* Increased initial base value of Thunderstorm.
* Thunderstorm Enhanced synergy is now much more efficient per point.
* Reduced elemental spell damage bonus from Thunder Essence by 25%.

3.9.3:
* Reduced strength of bosses.
* Bosses now spawn epic mobs instead of "minions" which was causing problems with minion summons.
* Equipping gear that gives + skills will no longer remove skill points from your tree (no more negative skill points available fix).
* There is a new stat that gives + all skills (only already allocated skills) - this stat is currently only accessible via modifying the datapacks, it is not available on any gear.
* The max bonus level for spells is now the max level * 2, rather than max level + 5. That means for example, Healing Wave can go up to level 32 from 16, instead of 21 from 16. This can be achieved from plus skill stats.

3.9.2:
* Fixed bug where users were getting no experience when playing alone.

3.9.1:
* Changed the Spell Blade effect from infusion to flat elemental weapon damage. Realistically, no one went for elemental spell damage in all elements so this spell was not very relevant.
* Increased the effectiveness of Nourishment and Ice Blade, and increased duration of all Ocean buffs slightly at earlier levels.
* Increased attack scaling and fire attack scaling of the "attack" spells in the Fire tree.
* Increased armor attack scaling of Retribution at earlier levels.
* Increased the early game health scaling of Martyrdom, but reduced the max health scaling by max level (by like 1%).
* Increased the mana cost of Martyrdom at later levels.

3.9.0:
* Party command now handles all of the party stuff - you no longer need to use /team!
* Hitting a party member will no longer knock them back.

3.8.22:
* Increased effectiveness of Healing Wave at higher levels.

3.8.21:
* Fixed Pacifist node.

3.8.20:
* Renamed Frost to Chilled to help prevent confusion between it and Frozen effects.
* Fixed Nature scaling not scaling properly.
* Made a lot of the tooltips more clear.

3.8.19:
* Changed Pacifist to reduce spell damage by a flat amount rather than a multi. This was causing some confusion becuase players thought their spell damage would decrease by half.
* Added stats to plate and leather uniques that were missing.

3.8.18:
Many of the changes below were to help the early-late game imbalance caused from some of the recent updates.
* Changed Whirlwind to scale off ALL weapon damage, NOT just physical.
* Reduced scaling of Whirlwind. In general this will benefit most builds.
* Increased base damage of Lightning Totem across the board.
* Increased base damage of Lightning Spear at early levels.
* Lowered base damage of Lightning Spear at max level by about 6%.
* Reduced the base damage of Burn at max level by about 8%.
* Doubled magic shield value from Frost Shield.
* Greatly increased the frost damage from basic attacks when enemies are frozen.
* Ice Blade now provides 25% more frost weapon damage.
* You now get 33% more regen from Cold Essence.
* Reduced the base value of all Hunting arrow skills.
* Reduced attack scaling of all Hunting arrow skills and Blast Trap, especially at earlier levels (max level remains more or less unchanged).
* Increased energy cost of Crossbows and Bows slightly.
Change to Mapping/Mobs:
* Mob rarities have been reworked in terms of rewards and stats. They are slightly harder now towards the upper rarities.
* A lot of players weren't aware that there were different boss types. Hopefully, the changes to difficulty of bosses and the change in summons will make it more inuitive. The 4 boss types: Berserker (speeds up when damaged), Necromancer, Hell Lord, and Replicator (the last 3 summon).
* Different boss types have been given identifying particle types. They previously only had witch particles.
* Bosses have had their rewards and difficulties increased GREATLY.
* Boss summons have been changed from Legendary rarity to Minion rarity, which is essentially between epic and legendary, but provides experience equivalent to an epic mob. this is about 30% of the experience they used to get. Farming the summons was too broken, so I've tried to shift it off the minions to the bosses so on average you will still get a lot of experience.
Fixes:
* Probably fixed a bug where custom dimension tiers weren't being applied properly... probably.
* Elemental resists on the talent tree now provide flat resists rather than increased resistances.

3.8.17:
* Increased rate at which gear is modified/repaired, etc.
* Hopefully fixed a dupe bug occuring rarely with the modify station.

3.8.16:
* Staves give flat spell damage instead of percent, this was how it was always supposed to be!
* Fixed spell lifesteal and lifesteal not working correctly.
* Increased lifesteal amounts from Draconic and Vampiric Blood.
* Reduced mana scaling and projectile speed of Battery Fusilade at higher levels. Increased cooldown very slightly.
* New game changer node: Fortified Reaction - converts dodge into armor, but multi dodge -25%. Located on the right side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Pacifist - greatly increases heal power and reduces cooldowns, but deal 50% less spell damage. Located on the top-left side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Vampire - gives a large lifesteal and spell lifesteal multiplier, but makes you lose all health regen. Located on the bottom-left side of the talent tree.
* New game changer node: Stout Defender - gives a huge amount of block while reducing some other defensive stats. Located on the left side of the talent tree.
* Moved Steady Hand to the bottom side of the talent tree.
* Added a ring in the center of the tree to improve options for pathing to the other side of the tree. I tried to make it not too "easy" so it'll still require a decent amount of points.
* Added some cooldown reduction and heal power nodes sporadically around the tree (weighted to the left).
* Added some node connectors in the middle of the left side of the talent tree to improve pathing a bit.
* Reduced effectiveness of the Magical Life node - the node now also gives -25% multi magic shield.
* Mana Battery now reduces armor as well, but reduces health, armor and dodge at a lower amount than previously.
* Familiar Instincts now reduces health regeneration even further.
* Made some tooltip text a little more clearer.
* Reduced slow % from Frost effect. The way slow was calculated, zombies would be straight up freeze in place with 40%.
* Rare crash with tridents should be fixed.
* Actually fixed dodge and shield sounds from not playing!!!
* Dodging now prevents knockback. Doesn't make sense to go flying if you've dodged the attack...

3.8.15:
* Defensive Root no longer lasts 100 seconds (lol). lasts ~10 seconds like it was supposed to.
* Defensive Root has been reworking into Natural Empowering, which instead of providing a defense bonus, briefly increases base attack speed and energy regeneration.
* Critical damage nodes from the tree have been reduced slightly.
* Lowered movement speed reduction when casting spells.
* Lowered healing amount from Heart of Ice at higher levels by about 25%.
* Increased healing amount from Healing Aura by about 33%. Also lowered cooldown slightly.
* New chaos stat which applies speed buff on crit 50% of the time.
The following changes were made to give magic shield more identity vs. health, as well as making gameplay feel a bit smoother:
* Fixed a bug where HP/MS regen was adding more exhaustion than intended when restoring less than the max amount.
* You will now regen as long as you are above 15 hunger, instead of 18.
* Health, mana, and energy now regen every 3 seconds, down from 5. This should make regeneration feel a little smoother.
* Regen values for health, mana, and energy have been reduced to compliment the above change. You should regenerate approximately the same amount on average.
* Magic shield now only regens every 10 seconds, up from 5.
* Magic shield no longer adds exhaustion.
* Reduced magic shield flat stat effectiveness by 25%.
* Increased magic shield regeneration stat effectiveness greatly. Basically, you will regenerate more magic shield, and you can have higher pools of magic shield, but you will lack methods of instant recovery and will have to wait a while for it to regenerate. This basically makes it better for one shots but worse for prolonged battles.
* The Harmony trait used to split HP restoration effects with 50% going to health, and 25% going to magic shield. It now splits it 33%/33% between the two resources.

3.8.14:
* Hotfix for Battery Fusilade.
* Hotfix for party command spam lel

3.8.13:
* Hotfix for Flame Blitz.

3.8.12:
New Skills:
* New Hunting skills: the following AOE trap spells can be placed and are triggered upon enemy entry: Snare Trap (prevents enemy movement), Blast Trap (does damage), Enfeeble Trap (weakens enemy armor and resistances).
* New Fire skills: Flame Blitz (rapidly strike in melee range, scales from weapon damage), Draconic Blood & Vampiric Blood (team buff that gives spell/attack lifeleech, respectively), Spell Blade (gives caster a high amount of elemental infusion for a short period of time).
* New Storm skills: Critical and Power Surge (increases crit chance and reduces ele dmg, increases ele dmg and reduces crit chance, respectively), Quick Charge (team buff that reduces cooldowns but increases mana cost), Battery Fusilade (unload your mana to deal damage based on your total mana with multiple projectiles).
* New Nature skills: Root - root yourself in place to bolster your defenses. The following curses apply in AOE, have no cast time and have low cooldown (their effects are not as powerful, because of this): Corrosive Shadow (lowers enemy movement speed, armor, and dodge), Mortality Sap (lowers enemy critical hit chance and damage), Thought Seize (lowers enemy magic shield regen, mana regen, and resists).
* Throw Flames has been renamed as Meteoric Strike and has been reworked to not be a channel spell anymore.

The following few changes were made to improve mixing different spell trees:
* Instead of having Cold Essence increase your frost damage (which only benefits the Ocean tree), it now provides a small amount of mana and energy regen (which benefits all builds).
* Tidal Wave's Freezing Waves no longer consumes Frost Essence and just does extra damage if the enemy is Frosted.
* Whirlpool's synergy has been changed to Rejuvenating Pool which applies the new Cold Essence.
* The Shiver effect is now obsolete/unused. With the new changes, elemental resist reduction has been moved off of Ocean, which now focuses more on sustain and utility. Additionally, it seemed sort of redundant to have so many Ocean effects with similar names.
* Thorns no longer reduces fire resist and now reduces healing power and health regen slightly.
* Burn now reduces ALL elemental resists by 5% instead of reducing frost resist by 20%.
* Frost now reduces elemental damage by 10% instead of reducing lightning resist. It now also slows by 40% instead of 50%.
* Static now reduces ALL elemental resists by 20% instead of nature/lightning.
* Lightning Essence now provides 20% to ALL elemental SPELL damage rather than just all lightning damage. It now also provides 40% less critical hit chance than previously (5% -> 3%), but this is because the new lightning skill adds quite a lot.

Other Balance Changes:
* Martyrdom and Retribution have been changed to physical damage type.
* A bunch of skills have had their max level reduced to compensate for the increased number of skills. This does mean however, that some of them are not as strong as they used to be at max level. I did this because players were unable to invest in two trees.
* True Hit now grants a 25% Crit Chance Multiplier rather than 20% Crit Damage Multiplier.
* Whirlwind base scaling values have been reduced at earlier levels but remains similar to what it was before at max level.
* Fixed Poison Cloud spamming console.
* Spell effects such as Burn now show the appropriate element (fire in this case).
* Added back buttons to the GUI where appropriate. No more pressing ESC and then H!
* Party commands now provide text feedback.
* Fixed some tooltip errors with some currency.
* Fixed an issue with Blazing Inferno, Charged Nova, Poison Cloud, and Whirlwind where you could reset their cooldowns for free.
* Increased damage of Ice Orb by 33% at early levels, and about 12.5% at max level.
* Nourishment grants 20% more health regeneration.
* Fixed a bug where Blizzard was freezing the user instead of mobs...
* Whirlwind no longer knocks back enemies.
* Purifying Flames and Martyrdom now knockback enemies.
* Recoil of Hunter now provides 1 stack on cast instead of 3, which makes sense because the max stack is 1 anyway. Consequently, the max level for the synergy is now 1.
* You now receive more critical damage and less dodge from Hunter Instinct.
* You now receive a lot more dodge from Wind Walk.
* Added some new hybrid elemental damage mob suffixes.
* You now move twice as slow as you would before while casting spells.

3.8.11:
* New stat: Spell Lifesteal! Lifesteal, but for spells!
* Added lifesteal and spell lifesteal nodes to the tree.
* Life/spell lifesteal now has a minimum of 1. So even if you do 6 damage with 1% lifesteal, you will still heal 1 HP.
* Major Arcana stat "Judgment" now provides spell lifesteal, and the "thirst of" affixes provide a minor amount of spell lifesteal instead of lifesteal.
* Increased crit hit and damage percents and multis, flat values are still the same.
* Nature's Balm has had its values readjusted again (buff).
* Flat physical damage values have been lowered, but percent has been increased. This means physical will about 20% less damage early game, but investing into physical damage will improve it about 30% more.
* Increased early game effectiveness of Retribution.
* Fixed some localization typos and made some stats/skills more clear. "Judgment" is now spelled correctly, yay!
* Plate gear now also provides armor.
* Leather gear provides a bit less HP.
* Increased durability of equipment, especially at lower rarities.
* Lessened the effect of gear damage on loot drop at lower levels. You will still definitely feel this at higher levels.
* Vanilla ores provide a little more fuel than they used to.
* Setting tiers in the Dimension Config should work now.

3.8.10:
* Added a new Hunting Skill: Hunter's Potion, instantly recover % HP on a long cooldown.
* I went a little too far, re-added some benefits to the core stats.
* Improved the spell damage percent mod max roll by 50%.
* Changed the max level of some Hunting skills.
* You now can unlock the Wind spells 5 mastery levels earlier.
* Improved the Wind spells.
* Reduced cooldown of Retribution.

3.8.9:
* An issue with skill rotation was that it required too many points into other secondary skills (Fire Bombs, Charged Nova, etc.) in order for them to be even useful. The initial cooldowns were too great, but were more or less fine at max level. To combat this, level 1 cooldowns for almost ALL spells has been reduced significantly, and max level cooldown remains more or less untouched.
* Ball + Thunder Spear spells have been slightly readjusted again, their early game effectiveness has been improved.
* The above changes also mean that you will see slightly less benefits to putting points into one spell, but is still useful to do so. It encourages branching out as well!
* Silent Wind movement speed reduction has been lowered.
* Nature's Balm has been reduced in effectiveness.

3.8.8:
* You will need to reset your skills after updating to this version!
* The goal of the following changes was to offset some of the power players were getting from raw stats. Now, it is more encouraged to split into two trees. Especially since there are more buffs available now.
* Core stats have been reworked. They now give much less benefits than previously.
* Ocean Tree and Divine Tree have been reworked heavily, there are 4 new skills for the Ocean Tree!
* Too many changes for Ocean Tree... TL;DR there are new buff skills and healing has been changed to heal over time.
* Hunting Tree now has 2 new buffs known as "Winds", you can activate only one of them at a time.
* Heart of Ice has been completely changed. It now works more like the old Healing Aura from the Divine Tree, which has also been reworked into a spammable.
* New Frozen effect that can be applied by a new Ocean skill - Arctic Breath (including Blizzard). Frozen enemies take additional damage when basic attacked and cannot move.
* Heavy Strike has been changed to Martyrdom - it now scales off of HP instead of weapon damage.
* Ground Slam has been changed to Retribution - it now scales off of armor instead of weapon damage.
* Some tooltip clarifications have been made.
* Casting spells no longer damages the item you are holding.
* Repair values have been ever so slightly increased. Common ore is still bad.
* Fixed localization error on Crystal of Ascension.
* Reduced Crit Multi of True Hits perk to 20%, from 30%.
* Reduced the power of Critical Hits/Damage substantially.
* Reduced effectiveness of penetration slightly.
* Reduced the power of Fire Bombs and Burn effect by about 25-33%.
* Reduced the power of ball spells and Thunder Spear very slightly.
* Divine auras now require varying mastery levels. They have had their values shifted slightly, as well.
* Added an HP multiplier config to dimension configs.
* There have been other minor adjustments that have not been logged.

3.8.7:
* Reduced mana cost and cooldown of Whirlwind, and very slightly reduced damage scaling.
* Map drop rate bonus when in maps has been increased from 4% --> 15%.
* Crystal of Ascension now has a level of 15 levels instead of 10.
* Stone of Corruption now increases an item's level by 5 rather than 2.

3.8.6:
* Fixed the Nether wart farm room not spawning in correctly, leaving players with an impossible map.

3.8.5:
* Inconsistencies in element naming has been fixed. Nature = Nature, Ocean = Frost, Storm = Lightning.
* Fixed some missing localization.
* Updated Divine Tree description to better reflect what it has become.

3.8.4:
* Mob experience on kill no longer takes into account only the highest damage from player, but rather from all players. Before, a mob with 12 HP could have taken 6 environment damage, 4 damage from player A, and 2 damage from player B, but distribute no experience because player A's 4 dmg < 6. Now, it'll still attribute the kill to player A, but will take into account all player damage, so 4 + 2 = 6 which is at least 50% of the mob's health. This should make party play feel a LOT better.
* You now receive an additional 20% experience for each member on the team. So 2 players get 120% / 2 = 60% per person, 3 players get 140% / 3 = 47% per person, etc.
* Fixed block sounds being played on bleed.
* You now must use a pickaxe to mine ores.
* You now require at least a stone pickaxe to mine ores.
* Ore blocks now use datapacks and can be smelted down into ores if mined with Silk Touch. This is particularly useful in enabling compatibilty with technology mods.
* Ore world gen rates for ores have been increased very slightly.
* Made it very slightly easier for players to get the kill when compared against environment damage.
Balance Changes:
* Increased cooldown of "ball" spells by 1s. Thunder Spear's cooldown was increased by 0.5s.
* The following changes were made to make Fire feel more consistent:
* Increased mana cost of Fireball at max level by ~9%.
* Doubled Burn proc. chance for Fire spells.
* Reduced damage of Burn by ~55%.
* Reduced tick rate and duration of Burn at max level slightly.
* Increased Thunder Spear damage by ~20%.
* Increased Static proc. chance for Lightning Totem.
* Ice Orb has more pretty particles.
* Increased cooldown of Heavy Strike by 1s.
* Increased attack scaling of Ground Slam by 20% at max level.
* Increased cooldown of Ground Slam by 1s at max level.

3.8.3:
* You should be able to interact with most gravestone mods in maps now.
* Dank Storage is now retrievable in maps if you accidentally place one down.
* Fixed some map rooms with signs as placeholders for mobs and loot. They should now properly spawn.
* Improved consistency of Spruce Mansion redstone room.

3.8.2:
* Reduced armor reduction of Enrage slightly.
* Fixed tick rate of console spam.
* You can now interact with shulker boxes in Adventure Maps.
* Increased energy cost of weapons. The cost in general was too low and it wasn't really necessary to allocate stats into energy sustain.

3.8.1:
* Added particles to basically every spell, and increased particle count for most spells. This should help with visual acuity!
* Fixed Arrow Barrage shooting only 1 arrow.
* Went a little overboard last patch: ball spell damage has been increased very slightly again.
* Physical spells have had a minor reduction in damage.
* Cooldowns of basically ALL (except ball) spells has been reduced GREATLY. I'm pushing spell rotation over spamming one spell!
* Increased chance to proc effects for some spells.

3.8.0:
* All weapons now roll different secondary stats. Melee weapons no longer have any weapon damage multiplier - axes no longer do double damage. Energy cost has been changed to reflect this, and the addition of new secondary stats should more than make up for this. The reason for this change was because spells didn't take into account the weapon damage multiplier. Ergo, physical spells should feel _much_ better to use now with all melee weapons. Bows and crossbows more or less remain unchanged (slightly reduced damage with addition of new stats).
* New Ocean spell: Ice Orb - shoot an orb of ice that sprays enemies in its path.
* New Nature spell: Poison Cloud - applies Thorns to nearby enemies (large AOE).
* New Hunting spell: Dash - literally a dash.
* New Physical effect: Enrage - makes enemies move fast and deal more damage, but take increased damage.
The following spell changes were made for a few reasons. Mages were a little too strong for the amount of investment they had to make. Also, a lot of builds devolved into ball spam, and other "stronger" and utility-based spells were not seeing as much play.
* Ball spells are now affected by cooldown but have had their cooldown increased. Their cooldowns are also now fixed and will not change upon leveling them.
* Ball spells and Thunder Spear have had their damage reduced by a lot. Emphasis is on skill rotation now.
* Hunting spells no longer have any cast time and have been greatly improved.
* Reduced max projectile count of Ground Slam.
* Physical spells have had their damage increased.
* Heavy Strike and Whirlwind have new synergies.
* Magma Flower's duration has increased, and mana cost decreased.
* Nature spells have been greatly improved (Gorgon's Gaze is actually good) and are more geared towards weapon damage --> spell damage rather than a weird hybrid.
* Nature's Balm healing has increased slightly.
* Storm and Ocean spells have been reduced in power slightly, while Fire has seen a general buff.
* All stack effects (Thorns, Burn, etc.) have been reworked. There is an issue with stacks that need to be fixed but in the meantime this band-aid fix should suffice.

3.7.9:
* Fixed incorrect synergy icon/text for Frostball.
* Fixed all elemental spell damage stat not working.

3.7.8:
Changes were made to balance physical vs. elemental spells. Elemental spells are more or less the same but investing into them should be a lot more rewarding. I tried to make it more viable to go for elemental builds over the current OP physical builds. As always, my goal is to slowly improve the balance between the elements, and to provide each one with a unique identity. Currently, water is utility/damage since it provides many slows and can boost the power of the other elements greatly. Fire scales slightly with weapon damage and has an improved burn. Thunder is pure spell damage. Nature is tank/DoT, and Hunting is bow. Currently, Divine is split between support and physical spells.

* Fixed BossPacket console spam.

* Added some new perk nodes around the tree.
* Added armor penetration to Reckless Blows but increased armor reduction from it as well.

* Mana Battery now stays active for longer and absorbs four times the amount of damage.

* Reduced volume of Ground Slam.
* Reduced power of Heavy Strike.
* Reduced power and projectile count of Ground Slam slightly.
* Reduced initial strength of Whirlwind. It still retains the same power at max level.
* Increased duration of Whirlwind.
* Reduced mana cost of Whirlwind.

* Increased projectile speed very slightly for "ball" skills.
* Increased slightly the cooldown of the "ball" skills. Overall elemental skills see a reduction in cooldown though.
* Reduced mana costs of most elemental skills.
* Increased base value of most elemental skills.
* Frostball now generates Frost stacks instead of consuming them, and tidal wave consumes them instead of generating them.
* Increased attack scaling moderately on most elemental skills that have it.
* Increased power of burning effect.
* It is now much easier to generate Burn stacks using Fire Ball and Frost stacks with Frostball.
* Increased level 1 attack scaling of Thorns, max level remains the same.
* The max stacks for Frost has increased from 5 --> 10.
* The slow per stack for Frost has reduced from 8% --> 7% per stack. Overall, you can now slow enemies by 30% more.
* Shiver now reduced Fire and Thunder resistance by 50%, up from 15%.
* Static now reduces only Thunder resistance, and reduces (base value) 3% per stack, up from 1%.
* Static now has a max of 8 stacks, up from 3. The only source of Static is from Lightning Totems, which has seen a general damage nerf because of this change.

* Very slightly reduced damage, radius, and tick rate of Lightning Totem.

3.6.14
* fix divine buffs expiring randomly after a few seconds

Low lvl maps give stuff like coal, mid lvl give gold, and high lvl maps can give even diamonds!
* fixed more dungeon signs
* fix stations dupe bug

3.6.12
* implemented an experimental simple way to minimize effectiveness of mob farms (ill implement configs later, first i need to see if it works)

3.6.11
* should fix mana cost reduction throwing exception on synergies that dont cost mana.

3.6.10
* starter item config is now common config

3.6.9
* trying out performance optimizations
* added ignored entities config, this stops stat data packets from being sent to client,
 should make servers less laggy as most entities are bats and fish, and you don't really care about their stats. 
 You could also add sheep for example, if you have a huge sheep farm that's laggy.
 * orb of blessing can no longer reroll unique gear's stats
 * orb of unique blessing can now only reroll them, and the instability hit is now much higher (as unique gears are much less random now, i'm toning down the amount of times you can modify them)
* made starter items a newbie gear bag instead. the bag now gives same items every time. 

3.6.8
* updated chinese lang
* added mastery descriptions by dreckz
* added 3 new divine buff spells
* removed some advancements

3.6.7
* added a new mastery: divine!
* added new fire mastery synergy
* removed deobf jar, seemed to confuse more non modders than it helped modders
* pets shouldnt take spell damage from owners anymore

3.6.6
* removed experimental map drop rate restrictions

3.6.0

SPELL REWORK!
* spell tree has been remade into masteries.
* spells and synergies now have levels
* synergies now cost mana
* removed some spells as i consider them bad (like geyser) and others because their spell school doesn't have enough spells, they'll probably be re-added later
* added some new spells
* spell damage stats are now percents and increase spell damage by percent, instead of adding to the damage.
* infusion reworked
* added cooldown reduction, mana cost reduction and cast rate stats (they might not be used yet though, but they're there)
* added +1 to spell school levels stat
* removed elemental conversion and transfer stats, mostly useless after spell damage became a percent
* huge easy aoe spells now have much larger cooldown, added other semi aoe spells that are harder to hit and can't hit that many enemies at once.
* added a new rune that adds levels to specific spells, you'll need that for after level 45

What should happen with the rework:
* players should think more about how many points they want to spend and where
* players should decide between base stats or spell levels
* players should be able to play 2 schools of magic that use different elements without feeling useless
* magic should be less op at endgame and more useful at early game.
* aoe clearing a bunch of mobs should be much harder to do, especially from range, as high aoe spells are under long cooldown

If the system didn't make some of these happen, please tell me about it.

Other:
* bosses now spawn less minions but they're all max rarity
* blocking fully now stops attack knockbacks. can't figure out how to stop the attack sounds though
* made vanilla teams usable for exp and friendly fire off.
* casting spells now slows you down
* server performance improvements (syncing mob stat packets to client should lag server less now as i almost cut down the packet size in half)
* added all the buildathon rewards that people asked for (still many didn't come claim them though)
* fixed unique cangetset field not doing anything in datapacks
* mobs now have a small chance to increase their own rarity and level by killing other mobs. (experimental feature but i think it will be good)
* decreased default regen hunger cost
* made weapon costs scale with weapon level. This is experimental until i see if it can be abused or not. If people find some way of using lvl 1 weapons to do a lot of damage 
then i'll have to switch back to scaling costs to player level.
* spells levels now dictate their damage and mana costs too. To get maximum player level of spell effectiveness you'll need +1 to skill level gear stats. (5 or 6 of them)
* added new affixes and runeword.
* increase default stat points per lvl
* as talents pic is no longer 3 mb, starting talents shouldnt freeze game anymore
* potion of spell reset now gives 10 spell reset points instead of 1, but its a bit more expensive
* added a lot more dungeon rooms by @Eclipse
