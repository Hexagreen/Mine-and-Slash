3.8.1:
* Added particles to basically every spell, and increased particle count for most spells. This should help with visual acuity!
* Fixed Arrow Barrage shooting only 1 arrow.
* Went a little overboard last patch: ball spell damage has been increased very slightly again.
* Physical spells have had a minor reduction in damage.
* Cooldowns of basically ALL (except ball) spells has been reduced GREATLY. I'm pushing spell rotation over spamming one spell!
* Increased chance to proc effects for some spells.

3.8.0:
* All weapons now roll different secondary stats. Melee weapons no longer have any weapon damage multiplier - axes no longer do double damage. Energy cost has been changed to reflect this, and the addition of new secondary stats should more than make up for this. The reason for this change was because spells didn't take into account the weapon damage multiplier. Ergo, physical spells should feel _much_ better to use now with all melee weapons. Bows and crossbows more or less remain unchanged (slightly reduced damage with addition of new stats).
* New Ocean spell: Ice Orb - shoot an orb of ice that sprays enemies in its path.
* New Nature spell: Poison Cloud - applies Thorns to nearby enemies (large AOE).
* New Hunting spell: Dash - literally a dash.
* New Physical effect: Enrage - makes enemies move fast and deal more damage, but take increased damage.
The following spell changes were made for a few reasons. Mages were a little too strong for the amount of investment they had to make. Also, a lot of builds devolved into ball spam, and other "stronger" and utility-based spells were not seeing as much play.
* Ball spells are now affected by cooldown but have had their cooldown increased. Their cooldowns are also now fixed and will not change upon leveling them.
* Ball spells and Thunder Spear have had their damage reduced by a lot. Emphasis is on skill rotation now.
* Hunting spells no longer have any cast time and have been greatly improved.
* Reduced max projectile count of Ground Slam.
* Physical spells have had their damage increased.
* Heavy Strike and Whirlwind have new synergies.
* Magma Flower's duration has increased, and mana cost decreased.
* Nature spells have been greatly improved (Gorgon's Gaze is actually good) and are more geared towards weapon damage --> spell damage rather than a weird hybrid.
* Nature's Balm healing has increased slightly.
* Storm and Ocean spells have been reduced in power slightly, while Fire has seen a general buff.
* All stack effects (Thorns, Burn, etc.) have been reworked. There is an issue with stacks that need to be fixed but in the meantime this band-aid fix should suffice.

3.7.9:
* Fixed incorrect synergy icon/text for Frostball.
* Fixed all elemental spell damage stat not working.

3.7.8:
Changes were made to balance physical vs. elemental spells. Elemental spells are more or less the same but investing into them should be a lot more rewarding. I tried to make it more viable to go for elemental builds over the current OP physical builds. As always, my goal is to slowly improve the balance between the elements, and to provide each one with a unique identity. Currently, water is utility/damage since it provides many slows and can boost the power of the other elements greatly. Fire scales slightly with weapon damage and has an improved burn. Thunder is pure spell damage. Nature is tank/DoT, and Hunting is bow. Currently, Divine is split between support and physical spells.

* Fixed BossPacket console spam.

* Added some new perk nodes around the tree.

* Mana Battery now stays active for longer and absorbs four times the amount of damage.

* Reduced volume of Ground Slam.

* Increased slightly the cooldown of the "ball" skills. Overall elemental skills see a reduction in cooldown though.

* Frostball now generates Frost stacks instead of consuming them, and tidal wave consumes them instead of generating them.
* Increased attack scaling moderately on most elemental skills that have it.
* Increased power of burning effect.
* It is now much easier to generate Burn stacks using Fire Ball and Frost stacks with Frostball.
* Increased level 1 attack scaling of Thorns, max level remains the same.
* The max stacks for Frost has increased from 5 --> 10.
* The slow per stack for Frost has reduced from 8% --> 7% per stack. Overall, you can now slow enemies by 30% more.
* Shiver now reduced Fire and Thunder resistance by 50%, up from 15%.
* Static now reduces only Thunder resistance, and reduces (base value) 3% per stack, up from 1%.
* Static now has a max of 8 stacks, up from 3. The only source of Static is from Lightning Totems, which has seen a general damage nerf because of this change.

3.6.14
* fix divine buffs expiring randomly after a few seconds

Low lvl maps give stuff like coal, mid lvl give gold, and high lvl maps can give even diamonds!
* fixed more dungeon signs
* fix stations dupe bug

3.6.12
* implemented an experimental simple way to minimize effectiveness of mob farms (ill implement configs later, first i need to see if it works)

3.6.11
* should fix mana cost reduction throwing exception on synergies that dont cost mana.

3.6.10
* starter item config is now common config

3.6.9
* trying out performance optimizations
* added ignored entities config, this stops stat data packets from being sent to client,
 should make servers less laggy as most entities are bats and fish, and you don't really care about their stats. 
 You could also add sheep for example, if you have a huge sheep farm that's laggy.
 * orb of blessing can no longer reroll unique gear's stats
 * orb of unique blessing can now only reroll them, and the instability hit is now much higher (as unique gears are much less random now, i'm toning down the amount of times you can modify them)
* made starter items a newbie gear bag instead. the bag now gives same items every time. 

3.6.8
* updated chinese lang
* added mastery descriptions by dreckz
* added 3 new divine buff spells
* removed some advancements

3.6.7
* added a new mastery: divine!
* added new fire mastery synergy

* pets shouldnt take spell damage from owners anymore

3.6.6
* removed experimental map drop rate restrictions

3.6.0

SPELL REWORK!
* spell tree has been remade into masteries.
* spells and synergies now have levels
* synergies now cost mana
* removed some spells as i consider them bad (like geyser) and others because their spell school doesn't have enough spells, they'll probably be re-added later
* added some new spells
* spell damage stats are now percents and increase spell damage by percent, instead of adding to the damage.
* infusion reworked
* added cooldown reduction, mana cost reduction and cast rate stats (they might not be used yet though, but they're there)
* added +1 to spell school levels stat
* removed elemental conversion and transfer stats, mostly useless after spell damage became a percent
* huge easy aoe spells now have much larger cooldown, added other semi aoe spells that are harder to hit and can't hit that many enemies at once.
* added a new rune that adds levels to specific spells, you'll need that for after level 45

What should happen with the rework:
* players should think more about how many points they want to spend and where
* players should decide between base stats or spell levels
* players should be able to play 2 schools of magic that use different elements without feeling useless
* magic should be less op at endgame and more useful at early game.
* aoe clearing a bunch of mobs should be much harder to do, especially from range, as high aoe spells are under long cooldown

If the system didn't make some of these happen, please tell me about it.

Other:
* bosses now spawn less minions but they're all max rarity
* blocking fully now stops attack knockbacks. can't figure out how to stop the attack sounds though
* made vanilla teams usable for exp and friendly fire off.
* casting spells now slows you down
* server performance improvements (syncing mob stat packets to client should lag server less now as i almost cut down the packet size in half)
* added all the buildathon rewards that people asked for (still many didn't come claim them though)
* fixed unique cangetset field not doing anything in datapacks
* mobs now have a small chance to increase their own rarity and level by killing other mobs. (experimental feature but i think it will be good)
* decreased default regen hunger cost
* made weapon costs scale with weapon level. This is experimental until i see if it can be abused or not. If people find some way of using lvl 1 weapons to do a lot of damage 
then i'll have to switch back to scaling costs to player level.
* spells levels now dictate their damage and mana costs too. To get maximum player level of spell effectiveness you'll need +1 to skill level gear stats. (5 or 6 of them)
* added new affixes and runeword.
* increase default stat points per lvl
* as talents pic is no longer 3 mb, starting talents shouldnt freeze game anymore
* potion of spell reset now gives 10 spell reset points instead of 1, but its a bit more expensive
* added a lot more dungeon rooms by @Eclipse
